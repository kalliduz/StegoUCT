# Agent Instructions

* Ensure the sources compile with Free Pascal (FPC).
* FPC is not installed here, so you cannot compile or run tests yourself.
* The user will compile the project locally and provide error lists.
* Expect to receive those error reports and use them to fix the code until `Unittests/UTestGoEngine.dpr` builds successfully.
